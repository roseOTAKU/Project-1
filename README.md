Git Instructions
Using Git Bash or other command line interface:

Run below command to retrieve the latest version from github to your local machine. ALWAYS run this command before editing or adding files in the git folder.

git pull
Below is the process of adding new files to the repository.

First run the "add" command. This can be used to add specific files or all files. For adding a specific file, run:

git add <filename>
For adding all files, replace the filename with a period:

git add .
Next, run the "commit" command. This stages the files to be uploaded with a message:

git commit -m "<commit message, example: Added new view file. or Fixed this bug. etc>"
Finally, to actually upload the changes to github, run the "push" command. We are probably going to be pushing to the master branch every time.

git push origin master
